## Introduction

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. The game features a snake that grows in length each time it eats an apple while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.
A classic Snake game implemented in Java using Swing with an added scoring system.


### Scoring

The scoring system awards 10 points for each apple eaten. Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score!



## Features

- Navigate the snake to eat apples and grow longer.
- Each apple eaten increases the score by 10 points.
- Be cautious to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the walls.
- The game over-screen displays the final score.

## How to Play

The objective is to control the snake, guiding it to eat apples and grow longer. Be careful not to collide with the snake's own body or the walls, as it will result in a Game Over.


## Controls
Arrow Keys: Control the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)


## Improvements
  My contribution or Improvements is that I developed about the Scores. When Snake eats an apple, it will give you 10 points as a reward. And at game over, it will show your Score.
